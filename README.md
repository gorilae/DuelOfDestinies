# Purpose
In tihs git repository, all unity code and documentation for the Duel of Destinies game created for Case Western Reserve University EECS 393: Software Engineering in the Spring 2019 Semester.

# Creation
This repository was created 3/19/2018 prior to the first demonstration to the Teaching Assistants for EECS 393.

# Additional Comments
The initial commits to this repository included work that was previously done, with the repository fully being implemented the week of March 18th. The individual minigames within this program are stored as separate .unity files, with the final game expected to be released as a singular .exe file. 

# Viewing This Project
To best view the code within this repository, we recomend using the most recent version of Unity. As of the writing of this the current version is Unity 2018.3.9 released on March 18th, 2019. When viewing within Unity, all of the minigames and full game controllers will be located in the Scenes folder within the Assets folder. All c# scripts created for this game will be stored within their individual minigame folder within ../Assets/Scripts. Note that the folder for each game script and the .unity files within the Scenes folder will have the same name, or at least a very similar name. c# scripts edited by Erik Espinosa were done within Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.
